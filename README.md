# STM32 RTOS Project with ADXL345 Accelerometer Driver

### Description:
Embedded software project that aims to implement an RTOS (Real-Time Operating System) on the STM32 microcontroller and integrate an ADXL345 accelerometer driver. The project's intent is to showcase the developer's skills in RT embedded systems.

The repository contains source code and documentation for the project, along with detailed instructions on how to build and run it on an STM32 board. The project is developed using the Keil IDE and makes use of the CMSIS (Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard) library and the HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) library provided by STMicroelectronics.
The main features of the project will include:
- An RTOS implementation using FreeRTOS, providing task scheduling and synchronization mechanisms for real-time execution of multiple tasks.
- A driver for the ADXL345 accelerometer, enabling the measurement of three-axis acceleration data and implementation of motion detection and vibration analysis algorithms.
- A user interface with a serial console interface for sending commands and receiving data from the STM32 board.
